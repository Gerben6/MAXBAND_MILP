# MAXBAND_MILP
A MAXBAND implementation in python according to the literature paper by J. D. C. Little, M. D. Kelson and N. H. Gartner (1981)

This program was developed to research the usage of a variable speed in signal timing plan creation for coordinated traffic controllers. 
MAXBAND is able to optimize the speed as part of it's variables.

The research, part of my Master's Thesis, has yet to be published.
